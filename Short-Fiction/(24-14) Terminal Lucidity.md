# Terminal Lucidity

Behind clouds made of soot, an angry crimson sphere drifted across the sky, setting everything it touched a fiery red. What weed could grow were sick, decaying or already rotten. Layers of ash coated the pebble-like eroded concrete, it was very much like walking in deep snow. He did not know how long he had been walking, where he was going, or why he started to walk, but as he did not feel tired, he did not see a reason to stop.

He was made not to feel tired, to forever follow every command he was given. To humbly serve the humans that created him, this was the purpose he was built for. But where could they be? He had not seen a human for so long he couldn’t even recall what they looked like. Where was everyone? They wouldn’t leave him alone, would they?

As he walked down a path fenced with strange buildings with walls made of glass, he noticed that someone was following him inside the buildings. He went up to the glass to greet the fellow, perhaps they could provide some guidance. On the other side of the glass appeared a beat up, messy looking android, the same model as himself. Only with their artificial skin layer burned so badly that they were nearly unrecognisable. He was surprised by this, people really shouldn’t let themselves go, not even in the current predicament. 

“You look rough, buddy,” he said with a smile. 

The android smiled back at him – how kind. They waved goodbye to each other and they parted ways.

Along his journey, he briefly stopped to examine an interesting looking hollow box. At closer inspection, he determined that it was made of some sort of metal, as it had begun to rust in some places. The object stood on four legs like a table and had a hollow inside that was filled with ash and debris. He knew he had seen something like this before from somewhere, but he could not recognise the strange object. He thought his owner might have one, but he wasn’t sure. He also wondered where his owner could be. And where could he be? For the first time in a long while, he was curious why he was walking.

He tried to recall the last command he was given. Perhaps he was tasked to acquire something, but he might have forgotten? It is not usual for him to forget, but glitches do happen, especially in weathers like this. But no matter how hard he tried to remember, nothing came to mind. That’s strange, not only he couldn’t remember the last command he was given, but he couldn't remember any he had ever received. There must be something wrong with his memory set. Perhaps some dust got into it, or the harsh sunlight messed with his neural network. But that is nothing to worry about. They will easily fix him up in any android service station. All he had to do was to walk in, state his serial number, and they would take care of him in no time. Yes, he will do this right away. He would walk in, state his number “B2S3…”, no, “B2…” “S4…” or was it… Well this is no good, without the serial number he won't be served at all. What should he do? Ah, perhaps his owner would know his number, he'll just have to ask. He looked around to ask them, but his owner was nowhere to be found. Where could they be?

Not long after, a little further, he crossed paths with the first human in who knows how long. It was a tall, blonde woman, paper thin, standing high above him. Her white dress was darkened by all the dust and soot. She was holding up some food item in one hand and smiled endlessly. Oh, what a wonderful smile she had. 

“Excuse me miss,” he spoke to her, “do you know where I am?” The lady did not answer, just remained motionless. “Do you know where my owner is?” — Silence. 

He stood there for a while, waiting for an answer that never came.

“Well, it’s getting dark, I must be going now. I can’t keep my owner waiting for too long.” He said goodbye to her and left her to do whatever she was doing.

It was almost sunset as he walked over some thick white lines painted on the ground, arranged in some order. What a strange design, he thought. Suddenly and without warning, a young girl ran past in front of him. 

“Hold up, don’t run!” he said, not really knowing why exactly. 

He thought about following her. She appeared much more energetic for conversation than the lady from before. Perhaps she is with her parents, who could give him directions. Or maybe she was all alone. If that’s the case, he should make sure she is alright. It is not right for a child to be alone in a dangerous place such as this. 

Perhaps in a sense of duty, or pre-programmed protectiveness, he went after her. The girl ran into a familiar looking building so fast her braids were flying behind her. 

“Wait up!” he said, but the girl was already too far away. 

As he entered the strange building, the girl was nowhere to be found. Now, where could she disappear to, he wondered.

The house was curiously familiar to him. He could almost recall the hallways, the rooms, the ugly, half fallen down wallpaper from his memory. Has he ever been here? Or is this just some trick his mind was playing with him? The floorboards under his feet creaked in a familiar melody. He looked around, examined the walls, the ceiling, the run-down furniture. He completely forgot about the girl. He was convinced he had been to this place before. But when? He wished he could remember.

At the end of the corridor, a room with a white closed door seemed to be beaconing him. Before he opened the door, he imagined the room he believed he would see on the other side. With a soft creak, he slowly opened the door. To his surprise, the room looked exactly as he pictured it. Except perhaps the huge gaping hole in the wall looking out to a scenic view of the bright red sunset. 

He went over the bed and created a dust cloud as he sat down on it. He looked at the sunset, mesmerised by how eerily tranquil it was. He was now very tired. Tired and confused. He felt that he did not have much energy left. His feet felt heavy and weary. He wasn’t sure if he even had energy to stand up from this bed, but now it didn’t matter. If he can’t move on, this place will do. 

The sun was still up, but it was getting dark. It was time for him to lay down and let his batteries run out. He knew he wouldn’t wake up, but it did not bother him. There was nothing he could do. There was nothing he wished he could do. He simply closed his eyes and waited. He wondered if perhaps androids could go to heaven. If, up there, they could give him directions. He could wait for his owner there, if they allowed him. He hoped he would be able to recognise the little Suzie.

Then, like a shock, a surge of energy ran through his neural network. As his neurons discharged their last bit of energy, a sudden clarity came over him.

“Oh, now I remember,” he whispered. 

A gentle smile appeared on his face. He knew where he was, this was the house where he served at. He remembered the birth lights. The loud noises. He remembered flying across the sky, crash-landing so far away from here. He remembered the little Suzie who inherited him from her father. He remembered looking after her, watching her grow up, becoming a capable adult. He remembered how much he cared for her. How as a child, every night without a miss, she would make him sing her favourite song. 

And as his last bit of energy dissipated, one last time, he sang a silent song.
